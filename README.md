This is a simple app that can be a great starting point for a beginner programmer who wants to take their JS knowledge to the next level.

Just [clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), and follow the comments in the code. Start at [/app/client/main.js](https://github.com/CodeChron/meteor-react-tutorial-notes-app/blob/master/app/client/main.js).  I recommend trying to build your own version of the app while reviewing the code and the comments.


## Run the app
1. Make sure you have [Meteor installed](https://www.meteor.com/install).
2. Cd into the ``app`` directory.
2. Install npm packages: ```meteor npm install```
3. Run the app: ```meteor```
4. View the app in your browser at ```http://localhost:3000```

## Some topics covered

- ES6 Modules (import/export)

- Creating React components using plain functions vs with React.Component
- Setting propTypes and defaultProps

and more...

### Getting caught up using git branches.
1. Clone the reop
2. Pull down all branches: ```git fetch --all```
3. View available branches: ```git branch -a```
4. Check out a specific branch: ```git checkout remotes/origin/[branchname]``` eg ```git checkout remotes/origin/01-setup```
