This is a simple app that can be a great starting point for a beginner programmer who wants to take their JS knowledged to the next level.

Just [clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/), and follow the comments in the code. Start at [/app/client/main.js](https://github.com/CodeChron/meteor-react-tutorial-notes-app/blob/master/app/client/main.js)

I recommend trying to build your own version of the app while reviewing the code and the comments.

## Some topics covered
- Eager vs Lazy Loading
- ES6 Modules (import/export)
- Publications and Subcriptions
- Creating your own mini CSS framework
- Creating React components using plain functions vs with React.Component
- Setting propTypes and defaultProps
- Defining and updating React component state

and more...
