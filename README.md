# A Basic Note-taking App Built with Meteor and React

This is a simple app that can be a great starting point for a beginner programmer who wants to take their JS knowledged to the next level.

Just clone the repo, and follow the comments in the code.

I recommend trying to build your own version of the app while reviewing the code and the comments in this one.

## Some topics covered
- Eager vs Lazy Loading
- ES6 Modules (import/export)
- Publications and Subcriptions
- Creating your own mini CSS framework
- Creating React components using plain functions vs with React.Component
- Setting propTypes and defaultProps
- Defining and updating React component state

and much more...
